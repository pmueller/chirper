Shitter is a purposefully insecure app for learning about and practicing web haxxing

If you want to run Shitter, you'll need the following:
Ruby, in all it's glory (this project was built and tested on 1.9.3)
The following ruby gems: sinatra, haml, sequel, rack-flash3 and I also recommend thin
Note: The old rack-flash gem will cause rack to explode

To run, just type `ruby Shitter.rb` in the top directory of the project, and visit localhost:<port given by the server> and hack the planet

There should be 2 XSS and 1 CSRF vulnerabilities right now. If you're able to find more be sure to tell me how you did it!
